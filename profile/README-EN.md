Welcome to Sacruda! Sacruda is _the_ tool to keep track of your school assignments and exams. We know how hard it can be to keep a clear head when progressing through your course, so we designed Sacruda to help you keep that head of yours clear. Hopefully Sacruda will help you as much as it helps us students in finishing _our_ courses. This project is from students, for students.

## Why Sacruda?

Sometimes the most complicated problems require the simplest solutions. We've noticed that keeping track of school assignments can really be a challenge for some people. If you recognize that, then Sacruda is for you. The solution to this problem is complicated, right? You need super advanced scheduling and weekly visits with someone to help you figure it out. The latter has some truth to it, but the former doesn't have to be so complicated! Sacruda can be your remedy.

It really is just a glorified todo list. Sacruda gives you a clear overview of which assignments have to be done, and which ones are already completed. And you're in control! You decide what teachers, classes and assignments you put in Sacruda. No supervisor can change what you put in there.

This all sounds well and good, but reading about it isn't going to convince you. What about signing up and getting started?
